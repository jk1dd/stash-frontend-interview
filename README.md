# Hotel Search Page

## Overview
Stash Hotel Rewards helps independent hotels compete with larger chains by providing a loyalty points program, member rates, and other special perks for Stash members when they book direct or through the Stash booking engine.

## Objectives
To begin, please fork this repository.  

Data for this project is provided in ```data.json```.

Create a new frontend application with at least three pages:
1. A hotels index page. You can use [our current hotels page](https://www.stashrewards.com/hotels) for inspiration. This page can be lightly scaffolded, as it is not the main focus of the project. You should not spend significant time here.
2. A hotel "microsite" page that displays information specific to an individual hotel. You can use [our current microsite page](https://www.stashrewards.com/hotel/seattle/the-state-hotel?search_guid=5a02b541-8282-41d3-bb7e-cf3e568814fa) for inspiration. This page can be lightly scaffolded, as it is not the main focus of the project. You should not spend significant time here.
3. A destination search results page for a searched city. This page should show all hotels for a given city with relevant data. You can use [our current destination search results page](https://www.stashrewards.com/travel/destination?adults=1&checkin=Tue+Jun+24+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&checkout=Thu+Jun+26+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&children=0&city_id=&hotel_id=&lat=47.6064&lng=-122.331&prev_view=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&radius=3&search_value=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&suppress_otas=true&view=destination) for inspiration. **This page will be the focus of the project**

The main portion of this project will be creating a search bar and designing a destination search results page for a selected city.

Each of these pages should display a search bar with the following inputs:
- City or hotel name
- Checkin and Checkout
- Travelers (including adults and children)

When a user inputs data and navigates to a different page, the data that a user has entered into this search bar should persist. Our site currently supports this functionality and you can use it for inspiration.

For the city search results page, we are not asking you to recreate [our current search results page](https://www.stashrewards.com/travel/destination?adults=1&checkin=Tue+Jun+24+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&checkout=Thu+Jun+26+2025+00%3A00%3A00+GMT-0700+%28Pacific+Daylight+Time%29&children=0&city_id=&hotel_id=&lat=47.6064&lng=-122.331&prev_view=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&radius=3&search_value=Seattle%2C+Washington+State%2C+United+States&suppress_otas=true&view=destination) per se. Instead, we want to see you put your own spin on the page. This means that you will need to decide which data to display and how best to present it.

In data.json, you will find data for around 300 hotels. If a hotel has a member rate, the daily rate provided in the hotel object includes a 10% discount.

Development is a collaborative process! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
